## ðŸ“Š Performance Validation Results

### Date Validation Testing
```
âœ… Valid 2025 Date: PASS (correctly extracted)
âœ… Year 2000 (Before YouTube): FAIL (correctly rejected)
âœ… Year 2004 (Before YouTube): FAIL (correctly rejected)
âœ… Year 2005 (YouTube Founded): PASS (correctly extracted)
âœ… Future Date 2030: FAIL (correctly rejected)
âœ… Future Date 2027: FAIL (correctly rejected)
âœ… Next Year (2026): PASS (correctly extracted)
```

### Timestamp Extraction Isolation Testing
```
âœ… 4 unique timestamps extracted correctly
âœ… No cross-contamination between records
âœ… All extractions using optimal strategy (regex-manual-google-takeout)
âœ… 100% success rate for valid input formats
```

### Quality Metrics Validation
- **Confidence Scoring**: Working correctly with realistic ranges (40-100%)
- **Date Validation**: Properly rejecting dates outside 2005-2026 range
- **Format Recognition**: High accuracy for Google Takeout standard formats
- **International Support**: Enhanced but conservative confidence for non-US formats

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Enhanced Confidence Algorithm
```typescript
// Conservative base confidence with strategic adjustments
let confidence = 40 // Lower base for more realistic scoring
+ strategyBonus(0-25) // Based on extraction method reliability
+ qualityBonus(0-20) // Pattern quality indicators
+ formatBonus(0-15) // Recognized format patterns
- penalties(0-30) // Fallback usage, ambiguous formats, etc.
```

### Quality Metrics Framework
```typescript
interface QualityMetrics {
  hasTimezone: boolean        // Timezone information present
  hasFullDateTime: boolean    // Complete date and time
  formatRecognized: boolean   // Known Google Takeout format
  dateReasonable: boolean     // Within valid YouTube timeframe
}
```

### Global Statistics Tracking
```typescript
// Cross-session performance monitoring
- totalAttempts: number
- successfulExtractions: number
- strategySuccessRates: Map<string, {attempts, successes}>
- overallSuccessRate: percentage
```
