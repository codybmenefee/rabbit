# Product Requirements Document: Lean Data Processing & Historical Storage

**Document Version:** 3.0  
**Date:** 2024-12-15  
**Status:** Final - Implementation Ready  
**Author:** Product Engineering Team

## Executive Summary

This PRD defines a lean approach to fixing data processing bottlenecks and enabling historical data retention for the YouTube Analytics Platform. We're implementing a simple, cost-effective solution using Web Workers for non-blocking parsing and Vercel Blob Storage for permanent historical data storage. No databases, no edge functions, no complexity.

## Current Problems

1. **UI Freezes**: Browser becomes unresponsive when parsing large files
2. **No Historical Data**: Users lose data between uploads (bi-weekly)
3. **Memory Crashes**: Large watch histories crash the browser tab
4. **No Progress Feedback**: Users don't know if parsing is working
5. **Limited Session Data**: Data is lost when users close their browser

## Critical Parsing Context

### HTML Structure (Google Takeout Format)

The watch-history.html file follows a consistent MDL (Material Design Lite) structure:

- Each watch history entry is contained within an outer cell with standard MDL grid classes
- Multiple content cells within each entry contain different data elements:
  - Primary cell: Video title, channel information, and timestamp
  - Secondary cell: Typically empty (placeholder for layout)
  - Tertiary cell: Product metadata and tracking information

### Data Points to Extract

The parser should identify and extract:

- Video title from hyperlink text
- Video ID from YouTube watch URL parameters
- Channel name from secondary hyperlink (when present)
- Channel ID from YouTube channel URL
- Timestamp in various formats (with timezone information)
- Product type (YouTube vs YouTube Music)

### Special Cases to Handle

1. **Advertisement Entries**: Filter out entries marked as "Viewed Ads On YouTube"
2. **Missing Channel Data**: Handle entries without channel information gracefully
3. **Timestamp Variations**: Account for different prefixes and formatting
4. **Product Differentiation**: Distinguish between "Watched" (YouTube) and "Listened to" (YouTube Music)

### Parsing Strategy Rationale

- Use deterministic DOM-based parsing for consistent, structured data
- Avoid probabilistic approaches when data follows predictable patterns
- Prioritize performance and reliability over flexibility
- Implement rule-based extraction for cost-effectiveness

## Solution: Three Focused Improvements

### 1. Web Worker for Non-Blocking Parsing

**Objective**: Implement background parsing to maintain UI responsiveness during large file processing.

**Implementation Direction**:

- Create a dedicated Web Worker module for HTML parsing operations
- Implement chunked processing to handle large files efficiently (suggest 1MB chunks)
- Design a message-passing interface between main thread and worker:
  - Accept HTML content as input
  - Report progress updates at regular intervals
  - Return parsed records upon completion
- Include error handling for malformed HTML or parsing failures
- Ensure worker can be terminated if user cancels operation

**Key Technical Considerations**:

- Chunk size should balance memory usage and progress reporting frequency
- Progress should report both percentage complete and records parsed
- Worker should handle all parsing logic independently
- Main thread should remain responsive throughout parsing

### 2. Historical Data Storage for Authenticated Users

**Objective**: Implement permanent storage solution for authenticated users with historical watch data and efficient retrieval.

**Authentication Integration**:

- Only save to Blob Storage when user is authenticated with NextAuth.js
- Use Clerk userId as the unique identifier for storage paths (e.g., auth().userId on server or useAuth().userId on client)
- Implement authentication checks before any persistent storage operations
- Provide clear messaging about authentication benefits

**Implementation Direction**:

**Storage Service Architecture**:

- Design a HistoricalStorage service class with the following capabilities:
  - Save new uploads while preserving historical data
  - Merge and deduplicate records across multiple uploads
  - Query specific time periods efficiently
  - Pre-compute common aggregations for fast loading

**Core Methods to Implement**:

1. **Upload Storage Method**:
   - Accept user ID and new watch records
   - Store individual upload for audit/rollback purposes
   - Retrieve and merge with existing master data
   - Apply deduplication based on unique record IDs
   - Save updated master file with compression
   - Update pre-computed aggregations

2. **Time-Slice Query Method**:
   - Accept date range parameters
   - Check for cached results first
   - Filter master data if no cache exists
   - Cache substantial query results for performance
   - Return filtered records sorted by date

3. **Deduplication Logic**:
   - Use Set data structure for efficient duplicate detection
   - Preserve original records when duplicates found
   - Sort merged results by timestamp (newest first)

4. **Aggregation Updates**:
   - Calculate total record count
   - Extract unique years and quarters
   - Compute top channels and viewing patterns
   - Store results for instant dashboard loading

### 3. Refined Processing Pipeline

**Objective**: Improve parsing accuracy and handle edge cases more effectively.

**Processing Improvements**:

- Enhanced error handling for malformed HTML entries
- Better timestamp parsing with multiple format support
- Improved deduplication logic based on video ID and timestamp
- Optimized memory usage during large file processing
- Progress reporting with estimated time remaining

## Storage Structure

**Blob Storage Organization**:

```text
vercel-blob/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ users/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {userId}/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ master.json.gz              # All historical records (deduplicated)
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ aggregations.json           # Pre-computed stats for fast loading
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ uploads/
        ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2024-01-01T00:00:00.json.gz   # Individual uploads (backup)
        ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 2024-01-15T00:00:00.json.gz
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ cache/
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {timeSliceKey}.json     # Cached time-slice queries
```
