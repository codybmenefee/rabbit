## Introduction

The YouTube Watch History Analytics App is a powerful tool that allows you to gain insights into your YouTube viewing habits. By uploading your watch history data (exported from Google Takeout), you can visualize patterns in your viewing behavior, identify your most-watched channels, and understand your viewing trends over time.
