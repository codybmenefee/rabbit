# Pre-computation Service Implementation Summary

> **Status:** Archived. The dedicated pre-computation service described here is not part of the current Convex-first architecture; these notes remain for future research only.

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive plan for implementing a dedicated pre-computation service to significantly improve frontend performance by pre-calculating aggregations and storing them with timestamps for fast retrieval. The implementation will reduce dashboard load times by 80% and filter change response times by 90%.

## Current State Analysis

### Performance Bottlenecks Identified
- **Client-side computation**: All aggregations computed in React components
- **Repeated calculations**: Same aggregations recalculated on every filter change
- **Large dataset processing**: Full dataset processed for each aggregation
- **Complex timestamp parsing**: Multiple format attempts for each record
- **Memory intensive operations**: Multiple Map/Set operations and array iterations
- **No caching**: No persistence of computed results

### Current Performance Metrics
- Dashboard load time: 2-5 seconds
- Filter change response: 500ms-2s
- Memory usage: 50-100MB
- CPU usage: High during computation

## Solution Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Aggregation Engine**: Pre-computes all possible aggregation combinations
2. **Cache Manager**: Multi-layer caching (Memory → Redis → Database)
3. **Storage Layer**: Timestamped storage with expiration policies
4. **API Layer**: Fast retrieval of pre-computed results
5. **Scheduler**: Incremental updates and cleanup

### Data Flow
```
New Data → Change Detection → Incremental Processing → Aggregation Computation → Storage → API Serving
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Database schema and migrations
- Core service infrastructure
- Feature flag system
- Basic caching implementation

### Phase 2: Aggregation Engine (Weeks 3-4)
- Data processor implementation
- Port all aggregation functions to service
- Performance optimizations
- Comprehensive testing

### Phase 3: API and Integration (Weeks 5-6)
- Convex API functions
- React hooks for frontend
- Component updates
- Error handling and fallbacks

### Phase 4: Data Migration (Weeks 7-8)
- Data migration scripts
- Backfill aggregations for existing data
- Data validation and consistency checks
- Migration monitoring

### Phase 5: Optimization and Cleanup (Weeks 9-10)
- Performance optimization
- Deprecated code removal
- Documentation updates
- Final testing and deployment

## Expected Performance Improvements

### Target Metrics
- **Dashboard load time**: < 500ms (80% improvement)
- **Filter change response**: < 100ms (90% improvement)
- **Memory usage**: < 20MB (80% reduction)
- **CPU usage**: < 10% during normal operation

### Scalability
- Support for 100k+ watch records
- Sub-second response times
- Efficient memory usage
- Horizontal scaling capability

## Data Storage Strategy

### Multi-layer Storage
1. **L1: Memory Cache** - Hot data, fast access
2. **L2: Redis Cache** - Persistent cache
3. **L3: Convex Database** - Persistent storage
4. **L4: File System Cache** - Large aggregations

### Data Models
- `PrecomputedAggregation`: Core aggregation data
- `FilterCombination`: Filter combinations and usage
- `DataChangeLog`: Change tracking for incremental updates
- `AggregationDependency`: Dependency management

### Lifecycle Management
- Time-based expiration policies
- Automatic cleanup of expired data
- Data retention policies
- Archive and cold storage

## Migration Strategy

### Gradual Rollout
1. **Parallel Implementation**: Run both systems side-by-side
2. **Feature Flags**: Control which system is used
3. **Data Validation**: Ensure consistency between systems
4. **Gradual Migration**: Move users incrementally

### Risk Mitigation
- Fallback to client-side computation
- Comprehensive testing and validation
- Rollback procedures
- Continuous monitoring

## Deprecated Code Analysis

### Files to be Removed
- `lib/aggregations.ts` - Move functions to services
- `lib/channel-aggregations.ts` - Move functions to services
- `lib/topic-aggregations.ts` - Move functions to services

### Functions to be Deprecated
- All `compute*` functions (15+ functions)
- Client-side data processing utilities
- Component-level aggregation logic

### Migration Path
1. Mark functions as deprecated
2. Create new service implementations
3. Update components to use new hooks
4. Remove deprecated code
