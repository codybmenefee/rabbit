# Cursor Rules for Rabbit

This project uses hierarchical documentation:
- Root `CLAUDE.md` for project architecture and patterns
- `AGENTS.md` for global agent rules and coordination
- Folder `CLAUDE.md` files for specific guidance

## Quick Reference

- **Components**: Use TypeScript interfaces, follow glassmorphism design
- **Business Logic**: Write pure functions in `lib/`, use strong typing
- **Testing**: Co-locate tests, aim for >80% coverage
- **Documentation**: Update relevant `CLAUDE.md` files when patterns change

## Key Patterns

- Data flows from props → aggregation functions → visualization
- Use Recharts for charts, Tailwind for styling
- Keep components under 500 lines, split by responsibility
- Maintain separation between parsing, storage, and presentation layers

See the main documentation files for detailed context and guidelines.
