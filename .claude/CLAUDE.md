# CLAUDE.md (.claude)

Purpose: Central agent knowledge base. Contains task context, recent changes, pending work, and specialized agent roles.

- Update `context/current-state.md` and `context/recent-changes.md` when behavior or structure shifts.
- Add or refine role docs in `agents/` when introducing new workflows.
- Keep examples and references in `docs/` concise and actionable.
- Do not place app code here; this folder is documentation-only.
